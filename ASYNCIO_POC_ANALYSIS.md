# AsyncIO SQLite Driver POC Analysis

## What Was Implemented

Created a proof of concept async SQLite driver (`db/drivers/asyncio_poc.py`) that demonstrates:

1. **Async context managers** for read/write operations
2. **Transaction management** without progress callbacks
3. **Savepoint support** with proper nesting
4. **Task-based concurrency** instead of greenlets
5. **Clean async/await API** without monkey patching

## Key Improvements Over Gevent

### 1. No Progress Callbacks
The gevent driver uses complex progress callbacks to yield control:
```python
# Gevent approach - hacky and error-prone
def _progress_callback(connection):
    with connection.in_callback:
        gevent.sleep(0)  # Force context switch
```

Asyncio handles this naturally:
```python
# Asyncio - automatic yielding at await points
async with db.read_ctx() as cursor:
    await cursor.execute(query)  # Yields here automatically
```

### 2. Clearer Concurrency Model
- Gevent: Implicit context switching, hard to debug
- Asyncio: Explicit await points, predictable behavior

### 3. Better Error Handling
- No segfault risks from callback reentrancy
- Standard exception propagation through async context

## Current Limitations

### 1. SQLCipher Support
**Problem**: No async SQLCipher library exists
**Impact**: User databases require encryption
**Solutions**:
- Option A: Create aiosqlcipher wrapper
- Option B: Use thread pool for SQLCipher operations
- Option C: Find alternative encryption approach

### 2. Database Connection Pooling
Current POC uses single connection. Production needs:
- Connection pool for concurrent operations
- Proper connection lifecycle management
- Read replica support

### 3. Migration Complexity
The change touches every database operation:
```python
# Current
with self.db.read_ctx() as cursor:
    result = cursor.execute(query).fetchone()

# New  
async with self.db.read_ctx() as cursor:
    await cursor.execute(query)
    result = await cursor.fetchone()
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Compatibility Layer
Create adapter that supports both APIs:
```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    async def read_ctx_async(self):
        # New async implementation
        
    def read_ctx(self):
        # Legacy gevent implementation
```

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
1. Start with read-only operations
2. Migrate background tasks
3. Convert API endpoints
4. Update write operations last

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Remove gevent dependencies
2. Delete compatibility layer
3. Update documentation

## Performance Considerations

### Advantages
- Better CPU utilization (true parallelism possible)
- Lower memory overhead (no greenlet stacks)
- Native asyncio ecosystem integration

### Potential Issues
- Connection pool overhead
- Async function call overhead
- Learning curve for developers

## Recommendations

1. **Start with WebSocket migration** - easier, isolated change
2. **Build SQLCipher solution** before database migration
3. **Create comprehensive benchmarks** to ensure no regression
4. **Consider FastAPI** for cleaner async web framework
5. **Extensive testing** at each migration phase

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate SQLCipher async options
2. Prototype WebSocket replacement
3. Design connection pooling strategy
4. Create migration tooling
5. Plan incremental rollout

The POC proves the concept is viable but highlights significant work needed for production migration.
