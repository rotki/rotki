Introduction
*************

When the rotki backend runs it exposes a websockets API that can be easily subscribed to. Through that API rotki backend pushes data to the subscribed clients (mainly the rotki frontend) in a continuous manner and as soon as they are available.


Subscribe
***********

In order to subscribe to the websockets api open a socket to the host/port combination that you have set for websockets in the backend and send an empty message.

Messages Format
*****************

All messages sent by the backend via websockets are stringified json and they have the following format.

::

    {
        "type": "legacy",
        "data": "{"some": 1, "data": 2}"
    }


The ``"type"`` attribute determines what kind of message it is and what to expect in ``"data"``.

Messages
************


Legacy messages
====================

The messages sent by rotki via the ``MessagesAggregator`` can be found in this type. The format is


::

    {
        "type": "legacy",
        "data": "{"verbosity": "warning", "value": "A warning"}"
    }


- ``verbosity``: The verbosity of the message. Can be one of ``"warning"`` or ``"error"``.
- ``value``: A string with the contents of the message.
