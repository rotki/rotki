Questions on the application
******************************

What is rotki?
=======================

rotki is an opensource portfolio tracking, analytics, and tax reporting application that respects your privacy. It is focused on Crypto assets but will also slowly facilitate tracking of more traditional assets.

Why should I use it?
=====================

Unlike virtually every other service out there which offers you the ability to track crypto assets, get analytics, and generate tax reports, rotki is a local application. And its basic version is also free.

A local application allows you to **own your data**. You don't need to give your API keys, or any of your financial history to a centralized third party. We strongly advise against using any such centralized services. Your data is not safe with them.

What does it offer me?
=======================

rotki offers tracking of all your crypto assets no matter where they are. Either on a blockchain or on one of the supported exchanges.


You can also manually input information on your Fiat assets (iow: how much EUR, USD e.t.c. you own) so that the analytics also take them into account. Manual input of action that you did and would like to be tracked is also possible by adding an "external trade"

It also allows you to get a tax report, essentially calculating all trades in a given period and determining your profit or loss depending on your given settings. For more details on what is offered and how to use it check the :doc:`Usage Guide<usage_guide>`.


Will it remain free to use?
============================

rotki's base version will always remain opensource and free to use. It's in github and even if the current maintainer stops developing for whatever reason anyone can pick it up and continue.
