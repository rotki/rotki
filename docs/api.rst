Rotki API
##################################################
.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2


Introduction
*************

When the Rotki backend runs it exposes an HTTP Rest API that is accessed by either the electron front-end or a web browser. The endpoints accept and return JSON encoded objects. All queries have the following prefix: ``/api/<version>/`` where ``version`` is the current version. The current version at the moment is ``1``.


Request parameters
********************

All endpoints that take parameters accept a json body with said parameters. If the request is a ``GET`` request then it also accepts query parameters since for multiple implementations a JSON body will not work.

Response Format
*****************

All endpoints have their response wrapped in the following JSON object

::

    {
        "result": 42,
	"message": ""
    }


In the case of a succesful response the ``"result"`` attribute is populated and is not ``null`` and the ``"message"`` is empty.

::

    {
        "result": null,
	"message": "An error happened"
    }

In the case of a failed response the ``"result"`` attribute is going to be ``null`` and the ``"message"`` attribute will optionally contain information about the error.

Async Queries
==============

Some endpoint queries can accept the argument ``"async_query": true``. When that is done the query is no longer synchronous but will instead immediately return a task id in the following format::

  {
      "result": {"task_id": 10},
      "message": ""
  }

The consumer of the API can later query the `ongoing backend task endpoint <#query-the-result-of-an-ongoing-backend-task>`_ with that id and obtain the outcome of the task when it's ready.

Endpoints
***********

In this section we will see the information about the individual endpoints of the API and detailed explanation of how each one can be used to interact with Rotki.

Handling user creation, sign-in, log-out and querying
==================================================

.. http:get:: /api/(version)/users

   By doing a ``GET`` at this endpoint you can see all the currently existing users and see who if any is logged in.

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      GET /api/1/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042
      {}

   **Example Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
          "result": {"john": "loggedin", "maria": "loggedout"},
	  "message": ""
      }

   :statuscode 200: Users query is succesful
   :statuscode 500: Internal Rotki error

.. http:put:: /api/(version)/users

   By doing a ``PUT`` at this endpoint you can create a new user

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      PUT /api/1/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042

      {
          "name": "john",
	  "password": "supersecurepassword",
	  "premium_api_key": "dasdsda",
	  "premium_api_secret": "adsadasd",
      }

      :reqjson string name: The name to give to the new user
      :reqjson string password: The password with which to encrypt the database for the new user
      :reqjson string premium_api_key: An optional api key if the user has a Rotki premium account.
      :reqjson string premium_api_secret: An optional api secret if the user has a Rotki premium account.

   **Example Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
          "result": {
	      "exchanges": ["kraken", "poloniex", "binance"],
	      "premium": True,
	      "settings": {
                  "version": "6",
                  "last_write_ts": 1571552172,
                  "premium_should_sync": true,
                  "include_crypto2crypto": true,
                  "anonymized_logs": true,
                  "last_data_upload_ts": 1571552172,
                  "ui_floating_precision": 2,
                  "taxfree_after_period": 31536000,
                  "balance_save_frequency": 24,
                  "include_gas_costs": true,
                  "historical_data_start": "01/08/2015",
                  "eth_rpc_endpoint": "http://localhost:8545",
                  "main_currency": "USD",
                  "date_display_format": "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S %Z",
                  "last_balance_save": 1571552172
	      }
	  },
	  "message": ""
      }

   :statuscode 200: Adding the new user was succesful
   :statuscode 400: Provided JSON is in some way malformed
   :statuscode 409: User already exists. Another user is already logged in. Given Premium API credentials are invalid.
   :statuscode 500: Internal Rotki error

   For succesful requests, result contains the currently connected exchanges, whethere the user has premium activated and the user's settings.

   For failed requests, the resulting dictionary object has ``"result": None, "message": "error"``  where ``"error"`` explains what went wrong.

.. http:patch:: /api/(version)/users/(username)

   By doing a ``PATCH`` at this endpoint with action ``'login'`` you can login to the user with ``username``.

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      PATCH /api/1/users/john HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042

      {
          "action": "login"
	  "password": "supersecurepassword",
	  "sync_approval": "unknown",
      }

      :reqjson string action: The action to perform. Can only be one of ``"login"`` or ``"logout"`` and for the login case has to be ``"login"``
      :reqjson string password: The password that unlocks the account
      :reqjson bool sync_approval: A string denoting if the user approved an initial syncing of data from premium. Valid values are ``"unknown"``, ``"yes"`` and ``"no"``.Should always be ``"unknown"`` at first and only if the user approves should an login with approval as ``"yes`` be sent. If he does not approve a login with approval as ``"no"`` should be sent. If there is the possibility of data sync from the premium server and this is ``"unknown"`` the login will fail with an appropriate error asking the consumer of the api to set it to ``"yes"`` or ``"no"``.

   **Example Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
          "result": {

                  "date_display_format": "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S %Z",
                  "last_balance_save": 1571552172
	      }
	  },
	  "message": ""
      }

   :statuscode 200: Logged in succesfully
   :statuscode 300: Possibility of syncing exists and the login was sent with sync_approval set to ``"unknown"``. Consumer of api must resend with ``"yes"`` or ``"no"``.

   The result is the same as creating a new user.

   For succesful requests, result contains the currently connected exchanges, whethere the user has premium activated and the user's settings.

   For failed requests, the resulting dictionary object has ``"result": None, "message": "error"``  where ``"error"`` explains what went wrong.

.. http:patch:: /api/(version)/users/(username)

   By doing a ``PATCH`` at this endpoint with action ``'logout'`` you can logout from your currently logged in account assuming that is ``username``. All user related data will be saved in the database, memory cleared and encrypted database connection closed.

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      PATCH /api/1/users/john HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042

   :statuscode 500: Internal Rotki error

.. http:patch:: /api/(version)/users/(username)

   By doing a ``PATCH`` at this endpoint without any action but by providing api_key and api_secret you can set the premium api key and secret pair for the user.

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      PATCH /api/1/users/john HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042

      {

Adding blockchain accounts
===========================

.. http:put:: /api/(version)/blockchains/(name)/

.. note::
   This endpoint can also be queried asynchronously by using ``"async_query": true``

   Doing a PUT on the the blockchains endpoint with a specific blockchain URL and a list of accounts in the json data will add these accounts to the tracked accounts for the given blockchain and the current user. The updated balances after the account additions are returned.
   Note that the message may even be populated for succesful queries, giving us information about what happened. For example one of the given accounts may have been invalid.
