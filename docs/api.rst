Rotki API
##################################################

  :maxdepth: 2


Introduction
*************

When the Rotki backend runs it exposes an HTTP Rest API that is accessed by either the electron front-end or a web browser. The endpoints accept and return JSON encoded objects. All queries have the following prefix: ``/api/<version>/`` where ``version`` is the current version. The current version at the moment is ``1``.


Request parameters
********************

All endpoints that take parameters accept a json body with said parameters. If the request is a ``GET`` request then it also accepts query parameters since for multiple implementations a JSON body will not work.

Response Format
*****************

All endpoints have their response wrapped in the following JSON object

::

    {
        "result": 42,
        "message": ""
    }


In the case of a succesful response the ``"result"`` attribute is populated and is not ``null`` and the ``"message"`` is empty.

::

    {
        "result": null,
        "message": "An error happened"
    }

In the case of a failed response the ``"result"`` attribute is going to be ``null`` and the ``"message"`` attribute will optionally contain information about the error.

Async Queries
==============

Some endpoint queries can accept the argument ``"async_query": true``. When that is done the query is no longer synchronous but will instead immediately return a task id in the following format::

  {
      "result": {"task_id": 10},
      "message": ""
  }

The consumer of the API can later query the `ongoing backend task endpoint <#query-the-result-of-an-ongoing-backend-task>`_ with that id and obtain the outcome of the task when it's ready.

Endpoints
***********

In this section we will see the information about the individual endpoints of the API and detailed explanation of how each one can be used to interact with Rotki.

Handling user creation, sign-in, log-out and querying
=======================================================

.. http:get:: /api/(version)/users

   By doing a ``GET`` at this endpoint you can see all the currently existing users and see who if any is logged in.

   **Example Request**:

   .. http:example:: curl wget httpie python-requests

      GET /api/1/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:5042

          "message": ""
      }

   :resjson object result: The result of the users query. Each element has a username as a key and either ``"loggedin"`` or ``"loggedout"`` values
   :statuscode 200: Users query is succesful

Querying all supported assets
================================

.. http:get:: /api/(version)/assets/all

   Doing a GET on the all assets endpoint will return a mapping of all supported assets and their details. The keys are the unique symbol identifier and the values are the details for each asset.

The details of each asset can contain the following keys:

- **type**: The type of asset. Valid values are ethereum token, own chain, omni token and more. For all valid values check here: https://github.com/rotki/rotki/blob/develop/rotkehlchen/assets/resolver.py#L7
- **started**: An optional unix timestamp denoting where we know price data for the asset started
- **ended**: If an asset is no longer in circulation this value should denote the unix timestamp after which price data is no longer available
- **name**: The long name of the asset. Does not need to be the same as the unique symbol identifier
- **forked**: An optional attribute representing another asset out of which this asset forked from. For example ``ETC`` would have ``ETH`` here.
- **swapped_for**: An optional attribute representing another asset for which this asset was swapped for. For example ``VEN`` tokens were at some point swapped for ``VET`` tokens.
- **symbol**: The symbol used for this asset. This is not guaranteed to be unique. Unfortunately some assets use the same symbol as others.
- **ethereum_address**: If the type is ``ethereum_token`` then this will be the hexadecimal address of the token's contract.
- **ethereum_token_decimals**: If the type is ``ethereum_token`` then this will be the number of decimals the token has
