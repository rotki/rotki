"""
This script runs pylint on the rotki codebase with the useless-suppression check on.
Then reads all the output, finds the files and lines and removes the useless suppressions.

There is a few problems with this and it's all due to pylint.
1. This does not find all useless suppressions.
2. It has false positives. Which means that it may flag as useless suppressions that are needed.

In general when the codebase has too many useless suppressions like the first time
I ran this, it's usefull. Removed ~500 occurences.  20 of them were false positives,
which I manually entered again later.

We should probably open bug reports to pylint for all of these at some point.
